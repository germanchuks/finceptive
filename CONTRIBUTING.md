### Making Changes

```

2. **Implement Your Changes:** Make your changes to the relevant files in the project. Adhere to the existing code style and formatting conventions.

3. **Test Your Changes:** Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they don't introduce any regressions.

4. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages that describe what you've done.
```
git add .
```
```
git commit -m "<YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE>"
```

### Submitting Your Contribution

1. **Push Your Changes:** Push your changes to your forked branch on GitHub.
```
git push -u origin <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
```

2. **Create a Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your forked branch to the main branch of the Finceptive repository. Click on the ```Compare & pull request``` button as shown below.
